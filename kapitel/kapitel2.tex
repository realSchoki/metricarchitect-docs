\chapter{Preliminaries}
\label{chapter:grundlagen}

Since the thesis covers many different systems each of them has to be introduced at least at a decent level. Modern and best of breed solution are being used here. Grafana and Prometheus are software products which can be used as an optional additional setup in cluster systems like Kubernetes to monitor their state. As a little bonus and for easier developing process Docker and Docker Compose are used but in a very simple way. The technologies form the target of the \gls{dsl} designed in this thesis. The meta modeling tool Cinco is used for the realization of the \gls{dsl} and necessary generators.
 
\section{Smart Home}

In the course of digitalization and simplification of the procurement of sensor technology in everyday life, smart home has arrived as an affordable concept for the consumer. In the most general case it is a base station with any number of actuators and sensors (\cref{fig:abstract_smart_home}). This station is used to process and store the data from the sensory elements of the network and the actuators act on the basis of decision tables, for example. 

As a simple scenario, one can imagine a living room lamp that is switched on when the brightness sensor outside signals darkness. However, a system does not necessarily has to have sensors and actuators. A network of sensors would only monitor and one of the actuators can only act. Examples would be a central power consumption monitoring per socket or a remote light control.

Here it is worth mentioning that there are also crossover devices. A heating thermostat usually has a built-in thermometer and is thus both actuator and sensor.

In this work icons in the model and \gls{dsl} are symbols from Font Awesome \footnote{\url{https://fontawesome.com/}}.

\section{Basic Terms}

In the context of Prometheus and this thesis, a few potentially ambiguous terms need to be defined.

\subsection{Metric}

A property which is observed and measured.

\begin{Definition}
	A metric is a single property to be measured.
\end{Definition}

\begin{Beispiel}
	Temperature, rain amount, brightness, transfer rate, amount of printed documents
\end{Beispiel}

\subsection{Sensor}

A sensor is a real device, a unit which is used in the real world. This can capture multiple metrics and make them available via an interface.

\begin{Definition}
	A sensor is a physical device making metrics available through some kind of interface.
\end{Definition}

\begin{Beispiel}
	Weather station, network switch, heating thermostat
\end{Beispiel}

\section{Prometheus}

Prometheus is an open source solution that is used for metrics monitoring and alerting. There is the possibility to pass data actively or alternatively to configure Prometheus to fetch data from different data sources. For the latter variant, the system to be monitored must provide a \gls{http} interface on which the data is delivered in a predefined manner. Finally the collected data is persisted on the internal time series database.

To simplify this process, there are several libraries for different programming languages that are configurable to export such a format. At the time of writing GO, Scala/Java, Python and Ruby are officially supported \footnote{\url{https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/clientlibs/}}, but for many other languages there are unofficial third party libraries which are advertised on the Prometheus website. 

Since Prometheus exports are not supported by every sensor there are possibilities to create adapters for the information flow from sensor to Prometheus. \gls{mqtt} is a technique of frequently pushing messages to a message broker. An adapter reads messages from the broker and provides the values in Prometheus export format. Creating adapters is out of scope and will not be covered.

In case the selected language is not supported, it is also possible to create the output yourself. For this, the definition of the output format has been well documented \footnote{\url{https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/writing_clientlibs/}}.

\subsection{Metric Types}

Prometheus distinguishes between different types of metrics. In the following, all possibilities are briefly explained. In \cref{subsec:Exportformat} a few examples are listed.

\subsubsection{Counter}

The counter describes a metric type which can only be incremented and reset. It represents a monotonically growing function. 

\subsubsection{Gauge}

This type symbolizes a speedometer. The values can rise and fall.

\subsubsection{Histogram}

A histogram (\cref{lst:concept_histogramm}) is a concept consisting of so-called buckets. These buckets have to be initially defined for each metric. With the help of this definition, values of $]-\infty,+\infty[$ are sorted into said buckets. Each next higher bucket also contains the measured values of the lower bucket (\cref{fig:relations_histogramm}). Therefore, it is a subset relation where the subsets are determined by the set limit. The \promcode{le} in the index can be interpreted as \textquote{Less Equal}. This parameter is also noted like this in the export.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tikzpicture}
	\draw (0,0) ellipse (1.5cm and .7cm);
	\draw (1.5,0) ellipse (3cm and 1cm);
	\draw (3,0) ellipse (4.5cm and 1.3cm);
	\draw (4.5,0) ellipse (6cm and 1.5cm);
	\path (0,0) -- (9,0)%
	node[pos=0] {$B_{le=``0.1''}$}%
	node[pos=0.33] {$B_{le=``0.5''}$}%
	node[pos=0.66] {$B_{le=``1''}$}%
	node[pos=1] {$B_{le=``+Inf''}$};
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{Relation of Buckets in a Histogram}
	\label{fig:relations_histogramm}
\end{figure}

A histogram represents, in addition to the buckets, a total number of measured values, which is equal to a bucket with \promcode{le="+Inf"} and a value for the sum of all values.

\begin{listing}[!ht]
	\begin{minted}{text}
	# TYPE <basename> histogram
	<basename>_bucket{le="<upper inclusive bound>"} <value>
	<basename>_sum <value>
	<basename>_count <value>
	\end{minted}
	\caption{General Concept of a Histogram Export}
	\label{lst:concept_histogramm}
\end{listing}

Line 2 can occur multiple times as each entry hat its own limit value. Lines 3 and 4 are the additional values as already mentioned.

\subsubsection{Summary}

A summary (\cref{lst:concept_summary}) is similar to a histogram, however these buckets are not filled by the value of the measurement but the measured values are divided into $\varphi$-quantiles ($0 \le \varphi \le 1)$ and the maximum value of the quantile.

\begin{listing}[!ht]
	\begin{minted}{text}
		# TYPE <basename> histogram
		<basename>{quantile="<Ï†>"} <value>
		<basename>_sum <value>
		<basename>_count <value>
	\end{minted}
	\caption{General Concept of a Summary Export}
	\label{lst:concept_summary}
\end{listing}

\subsubsection{Untyped}

In this case a value is assigned to the metric without following any special rules. This is the default type if not otherwise specified.
\Needspace{9\baselineskip}

\subsection{Labels}

Labels (\cref{lst:concept_label}) can be used to break down metrics with the same name into different origins. 

\begin{listing}[!ht]
	\begin{minted}{text}
	<basename>{key="<value>",key2="<value2>",...} <value>
	\end{minted}
	\caption{General Concept of Labels}
	\label{lst:concept_label}
\end{listing}

\subsection{Export Format}
\label{subsec:Exportformat}

The export format of Prometheus can be described well by means of an example (\cref{lst:prometheus_export}). For this purpose, we discuss an example of the official documentation~\cite{PrometheusExpositionFormatBeispiel}.

\begin{listing}[!ht]
	\begin{minted}[mathescape,linenos,numbersep=5pt,gobble=0,frame=lines,linenos,tabsize=4,breaklines,framesep=2mm]{text}
	# HELP http_requests_total The total number of HTTP requests.
	# TYPE http_requests_total counter
	http_requests_total{method="post",code="200"} 1027 1395066363000
	http_requests_total{method="post",code="400"}    3 1395066363000
	
	# Minimalistic line:
	metric_without_timestamp_and_labels 12.47
	\end{minted}
	\caption[Partial Example from the Official Prometheus Documentation]{Partial Example from the Official Prometheus Documentation~\cite{PrometheusExpositionFormatBeispiel}}
	\label{lst:prometheus_export}
\end{listing}

Between lines 1-4 the first exported metric can be found. The first line starts with \promcode{# HELP <name of metric>} followed by an short description. The next line specifies the type with \promcode{# TYPE <name of metric> <type of metric>}. The choices regarding the type coincide with the metric types already described: \promcode{counter}, \promcode{gauge}, \promcode{histogram}, \promcode{summary}, \promcode{untyped}.

All lines starting with \promcode{#} but not continued with \promcode{TYPE} or \promcode{HELP} are comment lines and are therefore not interpreted.

Lines 3-4 show the measured values split by their labels. Lines that symbolize the measured values consist of three columns. The first is in the format \promcode{<name of metric>} followed by optional labels in curly brackets. The example here breaks down all \gls{http} requests by \gls{http} method and \gls{http} return value. The next column contains the measured value for the metric, taking into account the different labels. The last column is again non-mandatory and contains the timestamp at which the value was measured. 
In addition, a small example in line 7 can be found. Due to the lack of type specification, the type is \promcode{untyped}. The \gls{ebnf} to the type of line holding values is shown in \cref{lst:ebnf_metric_export}.

\begin{listing}[!ht]
	\begin{minted}{ebnf}
	metric = metric_name, [ 
	"{",
	label_name, "=", '"', label_value, '"',
	{ ",", label_name, "=", '"', label_value, '"' }, [ "," ], 
	"}",
	],  value,  [ timestamp ];
	\end{minted}
	\caption{\gls{ebnf} for Exported Metric}
	\label{lst:ebnf_metric_export}
\end{listing}

In \cref{lst:export_histogramm} a complex example is shown. A histogram export with multiple buckets. Four preconfigured buckets with the limits \promcode{0.05}, \promcode{0.2}, \promcode{1} and \promcode{+Inf} are listed. Additionally the sum and the count of all values is appended. 

\begin{listing}[!ht]
	\begin{minted}{text}
	# HELP http_request_duration_seconds A histogram of the request duration
	# TYPE http_request_duration_seconds histogram
	http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.05"} 24054
	http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.2"} 100392
	http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="1"} 133988
	http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="+Inf"} 144320
	http_request_duration_seconds_sum 53423
	http_request_duration_seconds_count 144320
	\end{minted}
	\caption[Histogram Export Example from the Official Prometheus Documentation]{Histogram Export Example from the Official Prometheus Documentation~\cite{PrometheusExpositionFormatBeispiel}}
	\label{lst:export_histogramm}
\end{listing}

\subsection{Prometheus Query Language}
\label{subsec:promql}

As mentioned before, the collected data is stored in an internal time series database which can be searched by using \gls{promql} queries.
The syntax of the queries is appended as \gls{ebnf} and can be looked up in \cref{lst:promql_vector}. Only the significant parts for this thesis are mentioned.
Queries can be build from various elements with different functionalities.

\subsubsection{Instant Vector}

To access the collected data the instant vector has to be used. The instant vector query resolves in exactly one value for every stored metric respecting all available labels.

\subsubsection{Range Vector}

A range vector is similar to an instant vector. The main difference is an additional parameter describing how big the observed time segment should be. This time segment returns an amount of values per metric. Using this it would be possible to calculate a delta or a rate of change.

\subsubsection{Operators}

Since the vectors are sets of values or value arrays it is obvious that set operations are defined. Common operators like intersection, union and complement exist. Furthermore complex operators like grouping with other vectors or ignoring labels are available. There is also the option of using aggregation operators like sum or count, which reduce the result set to less values.

\subsubsection{Functions}

Functions act on every metric value itself. Known functions like ceiling, floor or round can be used. Furthermore uncommon functions like \promcode{year}, returning the year of the metric value or \promcode{changes} returns how often the value of the metric has changed.

\section{Grafana}
\label{sec:grafana}

Grafana~\citep{GrafanaHomepage} can be used for the visualization of the data collected by Prometheus. It is a versatile and extensible system to display data from various data sources. For example databases like Cassandra, MariaDB or PostgreSQL but also regular \gls{http} requests against external interfaces or static \gls{json} objects are possible~\cite{GrafanaDataSources}. Furthermore, Grafana also provides different types of diagrams. A small example is shown in \cref{fig:example_grafana_graph}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\subcaptionbox{Single Metric\\with Graph}[.30\textwidth]{%
		\centering
		\includegraphics[height=3cm]{assets/screenshots/Screenshot_2020-12-08 1 - New Features in v7 0 - Grafana.png}

	}%
	\caption{Example Diagram Types in Grafana}
	\label{fig:example_grafana_graph}
\end{figure}

Additionally there are simple table formats, honeycomb patterns, bar charts and many more. These, like the data sources, are extensible through plug-ins. Since this project is open source, custom plug-ins can be written if needed.

To fill the diagrams with data from Prometheus a \gls{promql} query must be stored in each diagram, which is executed regularly. Such a diagram is part of a so-called panel. Thus a panel has exactly one diagram and vice-versa. These are now combined into dashboards, which then provide an overview. With this feature it is possible to define a lot of panels for getting displayed at the same time.

It should also be said that there are higher order structures such as organizations or grouping dashboard into playlists. However, these features are out of scope and will not be covered.

\subsection{Panels}

Panels have many different settings and various individualizations. 

Each panel has primarily a name, description, diagram type and settings for the layout. Cumulative functions and behavior with zero values can also be specified. Depending on the selected chart type, different configurations are possible like axis labeling, legend, limits for symbolic coloring and other specific settings.

Alternatively to the grouping of metrics, which is possible by keywords, it is an option to display several metrics in one diagram by specifying multiple \gls{promql} queries. More can be found in \citetitle{Salituro2020} Chapter 6: Visualization Panels In Grafana of~\cite{Salituro2020}.

\section{Model-Driven Development}

Generalization, classification and aggregation form the most important technique in software development is called abstraction~\cite{Brambilla_2017}. Software development cannot exist without it, as it gives the developer the ability to ignore not important properties of a real world situation. Therefore, it helps breaking down the observed scene into essential parts leading to a simpler description of the given situation. As a synonym modeling instead of abstraction is frequently used. Based on this model, which is acquired by abstraction, a developer can now realize and implement a software which fulfills all needs and constraints expressed by the model. 

Nowadays complex world abstraction is indispensable and helps to create models in everyday life. It is a tool to eradicate unnecessary information or properties which can not be understood or it is not necessary to do so. 

A good example for a well know abstraction is an escape plan of buildings. The fundamental function of such plans is to guide people in case of an emergency out of the building in the most efficient and safe way. Since time is key in an emergency situation it is important to show only essential information. Data like the material of a door or wall thickness could be shown but would not match the purpose of the exit plan. Unnecessary data makes a plan complex. Instead, information like one way doors, unopenable windows or emergency exits should be marked. 

Abstraction is the fundamental technique of model-driven development. Additionally it utilizes different tools and standards for visualization, notation and the development process. A very common and popular notation is the \gls{uml}~\cite{Cook2017}. Powerful tooling and development assist can be found with \gls{emf}. This framework gives the ability to model in a well defined way using the meta model Ecore. As it is meta, it allows to describe other models~\cite[section 2.3.1]{steinberg2008emf}. The focus is on creating a perfect model, defining all constraints and dependencies. From here the implementation is just following the abstract model, since the work of discussing and committing to a mutual objective is already done.

\gls{emf} not only contains the Ecore model, but also a generator for example for code, custom files or an customized Eclipse \gls{ide} providing support for the model.

In the context of generating code different functions and feature were missed in Java~7. To fill this gap the language Xtend~\cite{xtendhp} was developed. It adds the possibility of using lambda functions,  template expression and more. Right now Java 15+ fills many of these gaps making Xtend not as important as it was in earlier days. This development resulted in changing the default language from Xtend back to Java, which was announced in a changelog in 2019. This decision was mentioned in the following cite.

\say{Also the resources we have no longer allow us to keep the head start against Java. And learning Xtend still is a burden for new Xtext users. To reflect this changed situation we have decided to make Java the default in the wizard again (except e.g. the Generator and a few other APIs).}~\cite{xtendToJava}

Since Xtend did not get fully replaced by Java there are still reasons to continue to use Xtend. For example, the template functions make constructing files easier through possibilities using loops, multiline strings or function calls.


\section{Cinco}

All technologies above are the base technologies used to create a model-driven solution. Since a \gls{dsl} has to be designed in this thesis the meta modeling tool Cinco~\cite{CincoHomepage} is used. The full name is \say{CINCO SCCE Meta Tooling Framework} and it utilizes the \gls{emf} and Graphiti Graphical Tooling Infrastructure. It is in active development of the chair for programming systems of the \gls{tudortmund}.

The \gls{mgl} allows the user to design a custom \gls{dsl} and generate a working \gls{ide} with features like auto complete or code generation like \gls{emf} already does. Additionally visual editing in the generated \gls{ide} is possible. Since modeling a \gls{dsl} which can be used in a visual editor lowers the threshold to get started with using this \gls{dsl} for non computer scientists essentially. 

With Cinco being a meta modeling tool generating graphical \glspl{ide} it is also necessary to influence the visual appearance and exactly describe the style of the elements defined in the \gls{mgl} files. For this use case it is possible to utilize the \gls{msl}.

	\label{fig:layeringCinco}
\end{figure}

From \cref{fig:layeringCinco} it is apparent that there is a clearly separated layering between different models in Cinco. The \gls{emf} as a framework for eclipse serves as the foundation for Cinco. Utilizing a \gls{dsl} called Xtext the \gls{emf} allows to define custom models. This is the point were Cinco starts. The \gls{msl} and \gls{mgl} are two of many definitions taking advantage of \gls{emf} to implement the needed features in Cinco. With this information an Ecore model can be generated which is needed for Cinco to work. As a Cinco developer it is possible to define a meta-model. In this case a sensor definition problem is used as an example. From this point on a user who works with the generated \gls{ide} for the sensor development can model the real world problems.

\subsection{Meta Graph Language}

Cinco uses four different elements for modeling a \gls{dsl} inside of it. The \gls{mgl} which is used for the modeling task defines nodes, edges, container and type elements. Having the ability of being enhanced with fields or dependencies between them they give the developer the opportunity designing a very powerful language. In other words, the \gls{mgl} is like a graph with nodes and edges expanded with optional containers where other elements can be stored. The type node adds the ability of defining other needed types. In general there is also the feature of extending already defined types, so little adaptions can be done and a greater level of abstraction can be reached.

\subsubsection{Node}

A node is an unit which can have incoming and outgoing edges. It can also have different attributes and a so-called prime reference. A prime reference is a pointer to any other node, edge or container. This allows to make connections between different models in different files. Because Cinco is based on the \gls{emf} it is also possible to reference any other object defined in external sources. To declare a node, the first token to use is \promcode{node} preceded by optional annotations and an optional \promcode{abstract} keyword, followed by the name of the node and a declaring body wrapped in curly brackets. The body can contain definitions for various attributes. Declaration of which edge types are incoming and which outgoing with optional constraints like quantities, a style option for correct visualization and a already described prime reference are common. An attribute starts with the keyword \promcode{attr}, preceded by optional prefixes like \promcode{final} and \promcode{unique}. A type and a name are appended, optional value limits and a default value can be set. For the edges \promcode{incomingEdges} or \promcode{outgoingEdges} can be used with the possibility restricting the allowed edges and adding a cardinality to this declaration. Styles can be applied to the node by using the \promcode{style} keyword with a style identifier.
Further the last token \promcode{prime} is used for adding a prime reference to the node. To be set up correctly the prime reference needs the type of the referenced element and a name.

\subsubsection{Edge}

Simpler constructs are edges. They are introduced using \promcode{edge} and can only contain attributes and a style. Like in the node definition annotations, abstraction flag or inheritance can be used without making cuts.

\subsubsection{Container}

Container heavily rely on the possibilities of a node. It is capable of all features of a node but being extended by the keyword \promcode{containableElements}. Thus it is possible to allow a specific object to be embedded inside of this container.

\subsubsection{Type}

Attributes can have different types. Therefore Cinco has the following build-in datatypes:

\begin{center}
	EString | EChar | EFloat | EBoolean | EDouble | EInt | ELong | EBigInteger | EBigDecimal | EByte | EShort | EDate
\end{center}


The custom datatypes can either be enumerations or user defined types which are groups of attributes. Optional inheritance is also possible. Enums are defined by \promcode{enum} followed by a name and all possible literals. The user defined type uses the keyword \promcode{type}, a name and the list of attributes written down the same way like in the node definition.

\subsection{Meta Style Language}

The first three of the four introduced possible elements of the \gls{mgl} are usable in the visual editor of the generated \gls{ide}. To give the model a better optical appearance it is necessary to specify the look of the components. The \gls{msl} allows to do exactly this. There are many different options of manipulating the representation of nodes, edges and containers in the editor. There is no default appearance, therefor it is necessary to set up at least a very basic style definition for the used elements. Further more it is possible to set text to show values from properties, polygons or other geometrical shapes. To get better in touch with this settings it is recommended to take a look on the Xtext definition of the \gls{msl} to understand the syntax of this language. Using images as a static resource or altering the colors of text and shapes is also possible without great effort.
