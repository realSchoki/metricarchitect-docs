\chapter{Introduction}
As the digitization proceeds it is important to not get overwhelmed by the complexity growing by time. \gls{it} assistance is the counterpart guiding and helping the society to master the difficulty of this development. To ensure that processes and devices are working and doing what they should a regular measurement and periodic observation are indispensable. In case of failure it provides the necessary information for fixing the problematic situation or even prevent them fully. Inside many devices build in sensors can be found which can be fundamental for correct functionality. For example engines measuring the rounds per minute, power or other properties. Also common devices like a fridge or the electric oven has thermometers since they need to know how much and when to cool down or heat up. 

The smart home is a topic accessible for everybody without being an \gls{it} professional. It is easy to set up a network of smart home components where room temperature or humidity is tracked, the light can be controlled from the smartphone and the heating is shutting down at night. 

For managing and observing those networks many tools can be used. Most of the smart home sensor devices have proprietary interfaces allowing to only work in a closed system from one manufacturer. Fortunately this does not apply to every device allowing to interconnect different devices from various manufacturers.
