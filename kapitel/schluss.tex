\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chapter:fazit}
The thesis shows that it is possible to abstract and simplify the process of creating sensor networks. Combined with modern technologies and software products like Docker, Prometheus and Grafana it takes a small amount of time to create a working software solution. 

The key problem with this technique is that the used sensors has to speak the Prometheus export syntax. Tasmota gave the opportunity to do exactly this. Still, even if this export format would not be supported it would be possible through other interfaces like \gls{mqtt} to export data and serve it in the right format manually.
